🚀 Day 3 of My DevOps Journey: Securing Servers by Disabling Root SSH Login

hey all. this one is interesting when I'm solving  

Task:

"Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter."

Before the deep dive, it needs to be understood why to disable direct SSH root login on the server. 

In many servers, the root account comes with unlimited power — the ability to install, modify, or even break the system with a single command. While that power is useful, it’s also a huge risk if left open for direct SSH login. Imagine a hacker gaining root access directly — it’s like giving them the keys to your house and the security system password at the same time.

So no other choice we have to lock it :

Our goal was to disable direct SSH login for the root user on the server, and users must log in with their own user accounts.

it helps:--

>>>Every action is traceable (we know who did what).
>>>>It reduces the attack surface for hackers.
>>>>>It enforces the principle of least privilege.

✅ Steps I followed:
   👉 1️⃣ Logged into Server  using SSH.
        >>>> e.g  ssh steve@stapp01  (sever)

    👉2️⃣  became root user and configure the sshd_config  Demoan file from  yes to no. this can be done by maually vi and vim. aslo but i did with automated streameditor.

>>>>sudo sed -i 's/^#\?PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

     👉3️⃣  then restarted the server for update of the file. it is mandatory 

>>>>sudo systemctl restart sshd.

After this i tried to login with ssh. im not able to login.
