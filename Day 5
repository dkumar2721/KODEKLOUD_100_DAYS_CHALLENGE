🚀Day 5:  SElinux Installation and Configuration 🚀



TASK:

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter:  



Install the required SELinux packages. Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes. No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight. Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled. 



this is a scenario i had. 



Why it is  needed?

Security audit flagged gaps → so SELinux is being introduced for hardened security.

But, instead of enforcing it immediately (which could break running apps if not configured), they’re:

Installing SELinux now → getting ready.

Disabling it temporarily → ensuring applications run smoothly.

Planning re-enable after configs → once correct SELinux policies are applied.

       applied.



Steps involved:

 👉 1️⃣   log into App server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter:  

  >>>> ssh tony@stapp01



👉2️⃣ install the application :

>>>>sudo yum install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted -y



👉3️⃣ AFTER installing configure the file to disable function.

>>> sudo vi etc/selinux/config

   after this :  

         SELINUX=disabled  (EDITED this changed from enforced to disabled )

  saved and closed the file.



👉4️⃣ once again reverified config file;

  >>>>cat /etc/selinux/config

      it should be  [ SELINUX=disabled ] like this .



after rebooting selinux will be disabled.



👉 This is a safe rollout strategy:

Install now → prepare system.

Disable temporarily → avoid disruptions.

Enable later with proper policies → achieve stronger security.
