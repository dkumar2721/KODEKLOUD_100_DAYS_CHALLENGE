🚀 Day 4 of My DevOps Journey:  🚀 file permission to specific file.

task:
Your task is  to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.

Why do we need to grant executable permission?
 ✅ Security control – Not every file should be executable; this prevents accidental or malicious runs.
 ✅ Role separation – Developers may edit a script, while operators only need to execute it.
 ✅ Flexibility – You can still run scripts with bash script.sh without +x, but giving execute permission
    



Steps involved:

  👉 1️⃣   first logged in using SSH
>>>>>ssh banner@stapp03 (server)

 👉2️⃣  became a root user and changed the file executable permission.
.>>>>> sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

To check its CORRECT:
               >>>> ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

its show the permission, details  and type of files 

here are  the breaks down:

there are 3 file permissions 
     >>1) read---r  =4
     >>2 ) write--w  =2
     >> 3) execute---x   =1.

Linux permissions are split into three classes:
Owner (u) — the file’s owner.
Group (g) — users in the file’s group.
Others (o) — everyone else.

chmod  u-g-o  ( this are the patterns )----this command is used for file permission.

so , Oue need is everyone can execute the file , but owner should all permission and rest all should execute permission.

so, chmod   U(r=4,w=2,x=1)  g(r=2,w=0,x=1) o(r=2,w=0,x=1)

here we got ,
 chmod 755 file_path  (THIS STATISFY THE ASSIGNED TASK. ensure that all users have the capability to execute it. ).

i'm so grateful i have done my day_4
